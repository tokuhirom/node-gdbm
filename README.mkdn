GDBM for node.js
================

Synopsis
--------

	var gdbm = require('gdbm');
	var db = new gdbm.GDBM();
	db.open("hoge.db", 0, gdbm.GDBM_WRCREAT);
	db.store("dan", "kogai");
	db.fetch("dan") # => "kogai"
	db.close();

Description
------------

GDBM is a GNU’s reinterpretation of dbm. You can use it as local KVS.

Methods
-------

### gdbm.GDBM.prototype.open(filename[, block_size[, flag[, mode]]])

Open database files.

`block_size`  is the size of a single
transfer from disk to memory. This parameter is ignored unless the file
is  a  new file.  The minimum size is 512.  If it is less than 512, dbm
will use the stat block size for the file system.

`flags` can  have one of the following values:

	gdbm.GDBM_READER: reader
	gdbm.GDBM_WRITER: writer
	gdbm.GDBM_WRCREAT: writer - if database does not exist create new one
	gdbm.GDBM_NEWDB: writer - create new database regardless if one exists

The `gdbm.GDBM_NOMMAP`  added to `read_write` by bitwise or instructs `gdbm_open`
to disable the use of mmap(2).

For the last three (writers of the database) the following may be added added to `read_write` by bitwise or: `GDBM_SYNC`, which causes all database operations to be synchronized to the disk, and `GDBM_NOLOCK`, which prevents the library from performing any locking on the database file. 

Mode is the file mode (see chmod(2) and open(2) ) if the file is created.

### gdbm.GDBM.prototype.store(key, value[, flags])

Key is the key  data. Value  is  the data to be associated with the key.
Flag can have one of the following values:

       gdbm.GDBM_INSERT
              Insert only, generate an error if key exists;

       gdbm.GDBM_REPLACE
              Replace contents if key exists.

If a reader calls gdbm.GDBM.prototype.store, the return value will be  -1.  If  called
with  `GDBM_INSERT`  and key is in the database, the return value will be
1.  Otherwise, the return value is 0.

NOTICE: If you store data for a key that is already in the  data  base,
gdbm   replaces  the  old  data  with  the  new  data  if  called  with
`GDBM_REPLACE`.  You do not get two data items for the same key  and  you
do not get an error from `store`.

NOTICE:  The  size in gdbm is not restricted like in dbm or ndbm.  Your
data can be as large as you want.

### var str = gdbm.GDBM.prototype.fetch(key)

Fetch the entry from database.

Key is the key data.

### var b = gdbm.GDBM.prototype.exists(key)

Key  is  the  key  data  to search for.

If the key is found within the database, the return value will be true.
If nothing appropiate is found, false is  returned. This  routine  is
useful  for  checking for the existence of a record, without performing
the memory allocation done by `gdbm_fetch`

### gdbm.GDBM.prototype.delete(key)

Key is the key data.

The return value is false if the item is not present or the requester is a
reader.  The return value is true if there was a successful delete.

### gdbm.GDBM.prototype.firstkey()

It’s possible to loop over every key in the database using this method and the nextkey() method. The traversal is ordered by gdbm‘s internal hash values, and won’t be sorted by the key values. This method returns the starting key.  

### gdbm.GDBM.prototype.nextkey(key)

Returns the key that follows key in the traversal. The following code prints every key in the database db, without having to create a list in memory that contains them all:

    var key = db.firstkey();
    while (key) {
        console.log(key);
        key = db.nextkey(key);
    }

### gdbm.GDBM.prototype.sync()

When the database has been opened in fast mode, this method forces any unwritten data to be written to the disk.

### gdbm.GDBM.prototype.reorganize()

If you have had a lot of deletions and would like to shrink  the  space
used by the gdbm file, this routine will reorganize the database.  Gdbm
will not shorten the length of a gdbm file except by using this reorga-
nization.  (Deleted file space will be reused.)

Unless  your database was opened with the GDBM_SYNC flag, gdbm does not
wait for writes to be flushed to the disk before continuing.  The  fol-
lowing routine can be used to guarantee that the database is physically
written to the disk file.
